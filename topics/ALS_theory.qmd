## Introduction

Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS), also known as LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging), is a remote sensing technology that uses pulsed laser light to measure distances to the Earth's surface. It has become a critical tool for characterizing forest structure and mapping terrain at high resolution.

This document provides an overview of ALS technology, its applications in forest ecology, important considerations when working with ALS data, and resources for further learning. **The perspective presented here draws from analysis of a global collection of airborne laser scanning data** spanning diverse forest types and ecosystems, from tropical rainforests to boreal forests, providing insights into both the capabilities and limitations of ALS across different environments.

## Terminology and Technology

### What is ALS?

**Airborne Laser Scanning** (also referred to as **lidar**, **LiDAR**, or **ALS**) is an active remote sensing technology that operates from airborne platforms. **When we refer to "airborne laser scanning" or "airborne LiDAR," this includes both traditional aircraft/helicopter-based systems and UAV-based LiDAR systems.** The system emits rapid laser pulses toward the ground and measures the time it takes for the light to return to the sensor.

## Key Terms and Terminology

**Interchangeable terms** (all mean the same thing):
- Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS)
- Airborne LiDAR 
- lidar
- LiDAR

Don't be confused by the different spellings and capitalizations!

**Additional important terms:**
-   **Point Cloud**: Three-dimensional collection of georeferenced points representing surfaces
-   **Terrestrial LiDAR (TLS)**: Ground-based variant for high-resolution local measurements [@jucker2023terrestrial]
-   **Full Waveform**: Complete energy distribution of returned laser pulse
-   **Returns**: Individual reflections detected from a laser pulse (first return, last return, etc.)

### How It Works: Full Waveform vs. Point Clouds

ALS systems technically record complete waveforms, but most applications use discretized data:

1.  **Full Waveform LiDAR**: Records the complete energy distribution of the returned laser pulse, providing detailed information about vegetation structure at multiple heights. However, this is very information-rich and computationally demanding.

2.  **Discrete Return (Point Clouds)**: Processes the waveform into individual return points using algorithms (usually provided by manufacturers). **Approximately 99% of ALS applications** use this discretized version, which is more compressed, easier to analyze, and simpler to share. Discrete returns typically capture:
    -   **First return**: Top of canopy
    -   **Intermediate returns**: Mid-canopy vegetation
    -   **Last return**: Ground surface

::: {.callout-note}
## Waveform to Point Cloud Conversion

The conversion from full waveform to discrete returns involves identifying peaks in the returned energy signal. This discretization makes the data more manageable while retaining most of the useful structural information for forest analysis.

## Why Airborne Laser Scanning?

ALS provides several key advantages over other remote sensing approaches for forest structure characterization.

### Spatial Coverage and Resolution

ALS provides **continuous, high-resolution coverage**  over large areas, which cannot be achieved with ground-based measurements and generally offers much higher spatial detail than spaceborne alternatives.

## A Critical Warning About Global Canopy Height Models

Recent years have seen the emergence of global-scale canopy height models that combine satellite LiDAR (GEDI) with optical imagery. While these represent important progress, **users should exercise extreme caution when using them for ecological analyses at present.**

**Current limitations of major global models:**

- **Meta/Facebook model** (high resolution, ~30m): Consistently underestimates canopy height, has substantial artifacts (e.g., clouds mistaken for gaps in tropical regions)
- **Lang model** (10m resolution): Overestimates canopy height and smooths out landscape-scale variation
- **Potapov model** (Landsat-based, 30m): Better estimates of mean height but loses fine-scale resolution

While these models capture general trends between biomes, they are **not operationally useful for most ecological studies at present.** For local to landscape-scale research, high-quality ALS data remains essential.
:::

### Advantages Over Other Methods

| Method | Coverage | Resolution | Canopy Penetration | Cost |
|:-------|:---------|:-----------|:-------------------|:-----|
| **ALS** | Regional to landscape | Very high (cm-m) | Excellent | High |
| **Satellite LiDAR (GEDI)** | Global (discrete) | Footprints (~25m) | Good | Low (public) |
| **Optical imagery** | Global | Medium-high | None | Low-Medium |
| **Field measurements** | Local plots | Very high | Complete | High |

## Word of Warning: Important Considerations

While ALS is a powerful tool, several factors affect data quality and interpretation. Understanding these limitations is crucial for proper application.

### Ecosystems Vary

::: {.callout-warning}
## Method Performance Varies by Forest Type

Many established ALS processing methods have been **developed and tested primarily in:**

-   Open canopy systems
-   Conifer-dominated forests
-   Temperate deciduous forests

These methods include:

-   Ground point detection
-   Individual tree segmentation
-   Understory characterization
:::

![Figure 10: Example of coniferous forest: a lot of methods have been developed and work well in conifer forests or open systems
(ground detection, tree segmentation, understory assessments).](ALS_figures/slide11_conifer_forest.png){width="80%"}



::: {.callout-important}
## Challenges in Dense Forests

**Many methods do not work as well in:**

-   Dense, closed-canopy deciduous forests
-   Tropical and subtropical forests
-   Multi-layered forest structures

In these environments:

-   Ground detection becomes unreliable
-   Tree segmentation is highly uncertain
-   Individual tree metrics may be impossible to extract

**Note on AI and deep learning approaches:** Even advanced AI techniques struggle with individual tree segmentation in closed-canopy forests. A fundamental limitation applies here: **if human experts cannot reliably delineate individual tree crowns, AI methods are unlikely to perform better.** This is not a temporary technical limitation but rather reflects the physical reality of overlapping, intertwined canopies in dense forests.
:::

![Figure 11: Dense tropical forest: a lot of methods do not work so well in dense, closed-canopy deciduous forests 
(especially in the tropics and subtropics).](ALS_figures/slide12_dense_forest.png){width="80%"}



### Instruments Vary

ALS data quality and characteristics depend heavily on:

-   **Acquisition season**
-   **Sensor specifications**
-   **Flight parameters**
-   **Processing approaches**

#### Seasonal Effects

![Figure 12: Comparison of winter/dry season (leaf-off) versus summer/wet season (leaf-on) acquisitions. Leaf-off conditions provide better ground penetration, while leaf-on better represents canopy structure](ALS_figures/slide13_seasonal_comparison.png){width="100%"}


::: {.callout-note}
## Seasonal Trade-offs

**Winter / Dry Season (Leaf-off):**

-   ✅ Better ground detection
-   ✅ Improved terrain modeling
-   ❌ Underestimates canopy metrics
-   ❌ Missing deciduous foliage

**Summer / Wet Season (Leaf-on):**

-   ✅ Complete canopy structure
-   ✅ Accurate height measurements
-   ❌ Reduced ground penetration
-   ❌ More challenging DTM generation
:::

#### Sensor Characteristics

![Figure 13: Impact of different sensor characteristics on forest structure retrieval. Adapted from @demol2024impact](ALS_figures/slide14_sensor_comparison.png){width="100%"} 



**Key sensor parameters affecting data quality:**

-   **Pulse density**: Higher is generally better (5-15+ pulses/m² recommended)
-   **Wavelength**: Near-infrared (1064 nm) vs. green (532 nm) - different wavelengths interact differently with vegetation and water
-   **Beam divergence**: Affects footprint size and penetration. Wide beams are more sensitive to upper canopy elements (hitting something at the top), while narrow beams can penetrate small gaps more easily
-   **Scan angle**: Central scan (nadir) vs. oblique angles
-   **Flight altitude**: Trade-off between coverage and resolution

::: {.callout-warning}
## Cross-Sensor Comparisons Require Caution

**Within a single study area scanned with the same system**, you can use relatively complex structural metrics safely. However, **when comparing across different sensors or acquisition campaigns**, you must be much more careful:

- **Simple metrics** (e.g., mean canopy height, percentile heights) are generally comparable across sensors
- **Complex structural metrics** (e.g., entropy, fractal dimension, box dimension) can be problematic when comparing different scans
- **Risk**: You may inadvertently measure differences between sensors rather than differences between environments

**Recommendation:** When working across multiple sensors or platforms, prioritize simple, interpretable metrics over complex ones. If you use structural complexity metrics, ensure you understand exactly how they work and validate that sensor differences don't drive your results.
:::

::: {.callout-note}
## Commercial Software for Ground Classification

For ground point classification specifically, commercial software (such as LAStools) often still outperforms open-source alternatives. If you receive point clouds that have been pre-classified by a company, **use those classifications rather than re-classifying** with your own tools. Commercial providers often employ manual corrections and have refined their algorithms over many years, making their ground classifications more reliable.
:::

## Robust Interpretation Approaches

To maximize reliability and minimize artifacts, different modeling approaches can be applied depending on research objectives and forest characteristics.

### Surface Models (Pixels)

**Raster-based** approach creating 2D gridded products. This is **the most common product from airborne laser scanning** and what ALS analysis historically started with.

**The basic concept:** Imagine draping a cloth over your point cloud. The cloth falls and settles onto the points, creating a continuous surface. You can control how far the cloth drops into gaps by adjusting weights - strong weights let it fall into small gaps, while lighter weights create a smoother surface that bridges over gaps.

This same process is applied to:
- **All returns** → creates Digital Surface Model (DSM) representing the top of the canopy
- **Last returns** (ground points) → creates Digital Terrain Model (DTM) representing the terrain

The difference between DSM and DTM gives you the Canopy Height Model (CHM).

![Figure 14: Example of pixel-based surface model approach. Source: @neon2024.](ALS_figures/slide15_neon_surface_model.png){width="80%"}



**Common raster products:**

-   **Digital Terrain Model (DTM)**: Ground elevation
-   **Digital Surface Model (DSM)**: Top-of-canopy elevation
-   **Canopy Height Model (CHM)**: Vegetation height (DSM - DTM)
-   **Intensity**: Laser return strength

![Figure 15: Example of elevation (left) and canopy height (right).](ALS_figures/slide16_elevation_map.png){width="80%"} 

::: {.callout-note}
## Ecological Patterns Visible in Canopy Structure

An interesting observation from processing ALS data globally: **you can often recognize terrain patterns directly from canopy height models**, even without looking at the elevation data. This is particularly evident in areas with subtle topography (like the Congo example above, with only 20-25m elevation change).

**Why this happens:** Forest structure is frequently determined by water availability. Trees grow taller and more vigorously in areas with better water access. As a result, you can sometimes trace:
- River courses through taller forest
- Valley bottoms with increased height
- Ridge tops with lower canopy heights

This demonstrates that canopy height models capture not just structure but also underlying ecological processes and resource distribution patterns.

### Volume Models (Voxels)

**Three-dimensional** volumetric approach that preserves vertical structure information. More computationally intensive but provides richer ecological information.

![Figure 17: Voxel model example: example of voxel-based volume model approach. Source: @atkins2018voxel](ALS_figures/slide18_voxel_model.png){width="80%"}



**Voxel-based products:**

-   **3D occupancy grids**: Presence/absence of vegetation in 3D space
-   **Plant Area Density (PAD)**: Vertical distribution of vegetation
-   **Structural complexity metrics**: Diversity of vertical arrangements
-   **Light penetration models**: Understory light availability

::: {.callout-tip}
## When to Use Volume Models

**Advantages:**

-   Preserves full 3D structure
-   Better for complex, multi-layered forests
-   Captures understory information
-   More ecologically meaningful metrics

**Best for:**

-   Habitat quality assessment
-   Biodiversity studies
-   Structural complexity analysis
-   Light environment modeling

**Limitations:**

-   Computationally demanding
-   Requires higher point densities
-   More complex processing pipelines
-   Larger data storage requirements

### Choosing an Approach

| Criterion | Surface Models (Pixels) | Volume Models (Voxels) |
|:----------|:----------------------|:-----------------------|
| **Processing complexity** | Low | High |
| **Computational demand** | Low | High |
| **Data requirements** | Moderate point density | High point density |
| **Forest type suitability** | All types | Complex, multi-layered |
| **Ecological detail** | Canopy-focused | Full 3D structure |
