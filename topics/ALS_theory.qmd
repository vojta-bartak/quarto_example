## Introduction

Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS), also known as LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging), is a remote sensing technology that uses pulsed laser light to measure distances to the Earth's surface. It has become a critical tool for characterizing forest structure and mapping terrain at high resolution.

This document provides an overview of ALS technology, its applications in forest ecology, important considerations when working with ALS data, and resources for further learning.

## Terminology and Technology

### What is ALS?

**Airborne Laser Scanning** (also referred to as **lidar**, **LiDAR**, or **ALS**) is an active remote sensing technology that operates from aircraft or drones. The system emits rapid laser pulses toward the ground and measures the time it takes for the light to return to the sensor.

## Key Terms

-   **ALS / LiDAR**: Airborne Laser Scanning / Light Detection and Ranging
-   **Point Cloud**: Three-dimensional collection of georeferenced points representing surfaces
-   **Terrestrial LiDAR**: Ground-based variant for high-resolution local measurements [@jucker2023terrestrial]
-   **Full Waveform**: Complete energy distribution of returned laser pulse

### How It Works: Full Waveform vs. Point Clouds

ALS systems can operate in two main modes:

1.  **Full Waveform LiDAR**: Records the complete energy distribution of the returned laser pulse, providing detailed information about vegetation structure at multiple heights

2.  **Discrete Return (Point Clouds)**: Processes the waveform into individual return points, typically capturing:
    -   **First return**: Top of canopy
    -   **Intermediate returns**: Mid-canopy vegetation
    -   **Last return**: Ground surface

## Why Airborne Laser Scanning?

ALS provides several key advantages over other remote sensing approaches for forest structure characterization.

### Spatial Coverage and Resolution

ALS provides **continuous, high-resolution coverage**  over large areas, which cannot be achieved with ground-based measurements and generally offers much higher spatial detail than spaceborne alternatives.

![Figure 4: Comparison 2-3 years of GEDI satellite shots (discrete points) versus ALS-based canopy height (continuous coverage).](ALS_figures/slide05_als_vs_gedi.png){width="100%"}



### Key Applications

### Advantages Over Other Methods

| Method | Coverage | Resolution | Canopy Penetration | Cost |
|:-------|:---------|:-----------|:-------------------|:-----|
| **ALS** | Regional to landscape | Very high (cm-m) | Excellent | High |
| **Satellite LiDAR (GEDI)** | Global (discrete) | Footprints (~25m) | Good | Low (public) |
| **Optical imagery** | Global | Medium-high | None | Low-Medium |
| **Field measurements** | Local plots | Very high | Complete | High |

## Word of Warning: Important Considerations

While ALS is a powerful tool, several factors affect data quality and interpretation. Understanding these limitations is crucial for proper application.

### Ecosystems Vary

::: {.callout-warning}
## Method Performance Varies by Forest Type

Many established ALS processing methods have been **developed and tested primarily in:**

-   Open canopy systems
-   Conifer-dominated forests
-   Temperate deciduous forests

These methods include:

-   Ground point detection
-   Individual tree segmentation
-   Understory characterization
:::

![Figure 10: Example of coniferous forest: a lot of methods have been developed and work well in conifer forests or open systems
(ground detection, tree segmentation, understory assessments).](ALS_figures/slide11_conifer_forest.png){width="80%"}



::: {.callout-important}
## Challenges in Dense Forests

**Many methods do not work as well in:**

-   Dense, closed-canopy deciduous forests
-   Tropical and subtropical forests
-   Multi-layered forest structures

In these environments:

-   Ground detection becomes unreliable
-   Tree segmentation is highly uncertain
-   Individual tree metrics may be impossible to extract
:::

![Figure 11: Dense tropical forest: a lot of methods do not work so well in dense, closed-canopy deciduous forests 
(especially in the tropics and subtropics).](ALS_figures/slide12_dense_forest.png){width="80%"}



### Instruments Vary

ALS data quality and characteristics depend heavily on:

-   **Acquisition season**
-   **Sensor specifications**
-   **Flight parameters**
-   **Processing approaches**

#### Seasonal Effects

![Figure 12: Comparison of winter/dry season (leaf-off) versus summer/wet season (leaf-on) acquisitions. Leaf-off conditions provide better ground penetration, while leaf-on better represents canopy structure](ALS_figures/slide13_seasonal_comparison.png){width="100%"}


::: {.callout-note}
## Seasonal Trade-offs

**Winter / Dry Season (Leaf-off):**

-   ✅ Better ground detection
-   ✅ Improved terrain modeling
-   ❌ Underestimates canopy metrics
-   ❌ Missing deciduous foliage

**Summer / Wet Season (Leaf-on):**

-   ✅ Complete canopy structure
-   ✅ Accurate height measurements
-   ❌ Reduced ground penetration
-   ❌ More challenging DTM generation
:::

#### Sensor Characteristics

![Figure 13: Impact of different sensor characteristics on forest structure retrieval. Adapted from @demol2024impact](ALS_figures/slide14_sensor_comparison.png){width="100%"} 



**Key sensor parameters affecting data quality:**

-   **Pulse density**: Higher is generally better (5-15+ pulses/m² recommended)
-   **Wavelength**: Near-infrared (1064 nm) vs. green (532 nm)
-   **Beam divergence**: Affects footprint size and penetration
-   **Scan angle**: Central scan (nadir) vs. oblique angles
-   **Flight altitude**: Trade-off between coverage and resolution

## Robust Interpretation Approaches

To maximize reliability and minimize artifacts, different modeling approaches can be applied depending on research objectives and forest characteristics.

### Surface Models (Pixels)

**Raster-based** approach creating 2D gridded products. This is the most common and well-established method.

![Figure 14: Example of pixel-based surface model approach. Source: @neon2024.](ALS_figures/slide15_neon_surface_model.png){width="80%"}



**Common raster products:**

-   **Digital Terrain Model (DTM)**: Ground elevation
-   **Digital Surface Model (DSM)**: Top-of-canopy elevation
-   **Canopy Height Model (CHM)**: Vegetation height (DSM - DTM)
-   **Intensity**: Laser return strength

![Figure 15: Example of elevation (left) and canopy height (right).](ALS_figures/slide16_elevation_map.png){width="80%"} 



::: {.callout-tip}
## When to Use Surface Models

**Advantages:**

-   Well-established processing workflows
-   Computationally efficient
-   Easy to integrate with other spatial data
-   Suitable for large-area analysis

**Best for:**

-   Regional forest inventories
-   Biomass estimation
-   Terrain mapping
-   Change detection over time
:::

![Figure 16: Detailed view of canopy height and elevation.](ALS_figures/slide17_surface_model_detail.png){width="80%"}



### Volume Models (Voxels)

**Three-dimensional** volumetric approach that preserves vertical structure information. More computationally intensive but provides richer ecological information.

![Figure 17: Voxel model example: example of voxel-based volume model approach. Source: @atkins2018voxel](ALS_figures/slide18_voxel_model.png){width="80%"}



**Voxel-based products:**

-   **3D occupancy grids**: Presence/absence of vegetation in 3D space
-   **Plant Area Density (PAD)**: Vertical distribution of vegetation
-   **Structural complexity metrics**: Diversity of vertical arrangements
-   **Light penetration models**: Understory light availability

::: {.callout-tip}
## When to Use Volume Models

**Advantages:**

-   Preserves full 3D structure
-   Better for complex, multi-layered forests
-   Captures understory information
-   More ecologically meaningful metrics

**Best for:**

-   Habitat quality assessment
-   Biodiversity studies
-   Structural complexity analysis
-   Light environment modeling

**Limitations:**

-   Computationally demanding
-   Requires higher point densities
-   More complex processing pipelines
-   Larger data storage requirements
:::

### Choosing an Approach

| Criterion | Surface Models (Pixels) | Volume Models (Voxels) |
|:----------|:----------------------|:-----------------------|
| **Processing complexity** | Low | High |
| **Computational demand** | Low | High |
| **Data requirements** | Moderate point density | High point density |
| **Forest type suitability** | All types | Complex, multi-layered |
| **Ecological detail** | Canopy-focused | Full 3D structure |
| **Analysis scale** | Regional to global | Local to landscape |
